## Monoids

#### Definition

A Monoid M <M;•,e> is an algebraic structure that satisfies the following rules:

1. The binary operation • on the set M is associative
2. There exists a left/right neutral element e such that e•a = a or a•e=a. If both left and right neutral element exist, then it's simply called neutral element.

## Groups

A Group G <G;•,^,e> is an algebraic structure that satisfies the following rules:

1. The binary operation • on the set G is associative
2. There exists a left/right neutral element e such that e•a = a or a•e=a. If both left and right neutral element exist, then it's simply called neutral element.
3. For each a of G, there exists an inverse element a^-1 such that the following equation is satisfied: a•a^-1 = a^-1•a = e

## Rings

A Ring R <R;+,-,0,•,1> is an algebraic structure that satisfies the following rules:

1. <R;+,-,0> is a group
2. <R;•,1> is a monoid
3. a•(b+c) = a•b + a•c and (a+b)•c = a•c + b•c for all a,b,c (distributivity)
